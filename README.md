**I developed this software because motivated to improve my efficiency and productivity. It is just an attemp/idea/prototype and it is not fully optimased or considered stable.**

**This project gave me also ideas to develop other tools** as [tool4NC](https://github.com/carmelosammarco/tool4NC), [MerOC](https://github.com/carmelosammarco/MerOC),[ads4MO](https://github.com/carmelosammarco/ads4MO)and [FTPsubsetMO](https://github.com/carmelosammarco/FTPsubsetMO). To know more about them just visit the projects web pages which are hyperlinked above.

Many thanks to visit this page and try this Jupyter lab enviroment created ad hoc to operate with the NetCDF data.
